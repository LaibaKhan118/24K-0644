Q1: There are a number of drawers each containing a pair of socks. Write step-by-step instructions to sort them into either ascending or descending order.
1. Start
2. Take the socks from all drawers
3. Find the biggest sock and put it in the first drawer.
4. Find the sock smaller than the last one and put it in the next drawer.
5. Repeat Step 4 until all the socks are placed in a drawer.
6. End


Q2: Input 2 numbers. Add them together. Multiply the resultant number to the second number. Check if this product is even or odd and if it is +ve or -ve.

START
// Inputs
INPUT num1
INPUT num2

// variable declaration and initialization
SET sum to 0
SET result to 0
SET remainder to 0

// Process Steps for addition and multiplication
SET sum to num1 + num2
SET result to sum * num2

// Conditional statements for a positive or negative number
IF result >= 0 THEN
	PRINT "The number is positive"
ELSE
	PRINT "The number is negative"

// Process steps for calculating the remainder
SET remainder to result mod 2

// Conditional Statements for even or odd
IF remainder == 0 THEN
	PRINT "It is an even number"
ELSE
	PRINT "It is an odd number"

END
