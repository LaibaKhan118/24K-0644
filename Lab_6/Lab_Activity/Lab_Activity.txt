// in for loop we can increment or decrement in its paranthese 
// however, in while (if required) you can skip that (e.g. user input)
// do while and while has only one difference, do-while executes code once no matter what the condition is because it checks the condition after executing the code once.

coditional loop: A condition for termination is present in the loop.
unconditional loop: A condition is not defined. (we can terminate the loop using break statement otherwise it will run infinitly)
e.g:
while(1) {
	printf();
	if(condition)
		break;
}

for(;;){
	//statements
break;
}
