Q1. Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

START
ASK the user to enter the number
ASK the user to enter the divisor
SET remainder to (number % divisor)
IF remainder is eqauls to zero THEN 
  DISPLAY "It is a divisor"
  IF (remainder % 2) is equals to 0 THEN
    DISPLAY "It is an even number
  ELSE
    DISPLAY "It is an odd number"
ELSE
  DISPLAY "It is not a divisor"
END



Q2. Implement an algorithm where the user enters a number, and an appropriate month is displayed.

START
ASK the user to enter a number between 1 and 12
IF number = 1 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is January."
ELSE IF number = 2 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is February."
ELSE IF number = 3 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is March."
ELSE IF number = 4 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is April."
ELSE IF number = 5 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is May."
ELSE IF number = 6 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is June."
ELSE IF number = 7 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is July."
ELSE IF number = 8 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is August."
ELSE IF number = 9 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is September."
ELSE IF number = 10 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is October."
ELSE IF number = 11 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is November."
ELSE IF number = 12 THEN
  DISPLAY "The month is December."
ELSE
  DISPLAY "Invalid month number."
END



============ OR ==============

Start the program
Ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 12
If the number is 1 then display "January"
Otherwise if the number is 2 then display "February"
Otherwise if the number is 3 then display "March"
Otherwise if the number is 4 then display "April"
Otherwise if the number is 5 then display "May"
Otherwise if the number is 6 then display "June"
Otherwise if the number is 7 then display "July"
Otherwise if the number is 8 then display "August"
Otherwise if the number is 9 then display "September"
Otherwise if the number is 10 then display "October"
Otherwise if the number is 11 then display "November"
Otherwise if the number is 12 then display "December"
Otherwise display "Invalid number"
End the program.


Q3. Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%).

START
DISPLAY "Select 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication, 4 for Division"
ASK the user to choose a number for the operation they would like to perform
IF the number is not between 1 and 4 THEN
  DISPLAY "INVALID Selection."
  END
ELSE
  ASK the user to enter the first number (a)
  ASK the user to enter the second number (b)
  IF the user chose 1 THEN
    SET c to (a + b)
    DISPLAY c
  ELSE IF the user chose 2 THEN
    SET c to (a - b)
    DISPLAY c
  ELSE IF the user chose 3 THEN
    SET c to (a * b)
    DISPLAY c
  ELSE IF the user chose 4 THEN
    IF (b = 0) THEN
      DISPLAY "Undefined"
    ELSE
      SET c to (a / b)
      DISPLAY c
END

==========OR===================

Start the program
Display "Select 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication, 4 for Division"
Ask the user to choose a number for the operation they would like to perform.
If the number is not between 1 and 4 then display "Invalid Selection" and end the program
Otherwise, Ask the user to enter the first number (a) and the second number (b)
If the user chose 1 for operation then set c to (a + b) and display c.
Otherwise, if the user chose 2 for operation then set c to (a - b) and display c.
Otherwise, if the user chose 3 for operation then set c to (a * b) and display c.
Otherwise, if the user chose 4 for operation then check if b = 0.
If it is then Display "Undefined." 
Otherwise set c to (a / b) and display c.
End the program.
